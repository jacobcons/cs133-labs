<h1>Lab 1: UNIX Essentials</h1>

<h2>Exercises:</h2>
<ol>
	<li>
		We had to download resources for the lab session and unzip them in our home directory
	</li>
	<li>
		We had to create a bunch of directories/files in public_html (a few being copied from the lab resources), ensuring that "others" had read permissions on everything and execute permissions on just the directories
	</li>

</ol>

<h2>Commands:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		You can change the directory that the man path searches in using
		<div class="code">export MANPATH=$(man -w):$PATH</div>
